ERA5‑Land Data Extraction for Hydrological Modelling
This repository documents how ERA5‑Land NetCDF data were extracted and processed for use in hydrological modelling.
The goal was to generate daily, basin‑representative meteorological inputs that are spatially and temporally consistent with local hydrological processes.

Data Source

Dataset: ERA5‑Land
Format: NetCDF (.nc)
Native resolution:

Spatial: ~0.1° × 0.1°
Temporal: Hourly (UTC)


Processing Steps
1. Select ERA5‑Land Grid Cells
All ERA5‑Land grid cells overlapping the basin were selected.
Partial overlaps were explicitly considered (no simple nearest‑cell method).

2. Area‑Weighted Spatial Averaging
Basin‑average values were calculated using area‑weighted averaging.
Each grid cell contributed according to the fraction of its area inside the basin.
This avoids bias caused by irregular basin shapes or coarse grids.
✅ Used for all variables (precipitation, temperature, etc.)

3. Convert Time to Local Time
ERA5‑Land data are provided in UTC.
Time was converted to local time (Nepal Standard Time, UTC+05:45).
This step was done before daily aggregation.
✅ Ensures correct daily rainfall totals
✅ Ensures Tmax/Tmin reflect real local day–night cycles

4. Temporal Aggregation (Hourly → Daily)
After local time conversion:
Precipitation: daily sum
Tmax: daily maximum
Tmin: daily minimum
Daily resolution was preserved for hydrological modelling.

5. Output
Final outputs are daily basin‑average time series
Suitable for use in hydrological models (e.g., SWAT)
Units and timestamps are consistent and quality‑checked

Key Features
✅ Area‑weighted spatial averaging
✅ Local time handling (UTC → local time)
✅ Daily hydrological forcing
✅ Physically consistent for mountainous basins
